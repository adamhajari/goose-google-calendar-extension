# Using with Goose Desktop

## Installation for Goose Desktop

The Goose desktop application handles extensions differently than the command-line version. Here's how to set up the Google Calendar extension:

### Method 1: Install via Package Manager

1. **Install the extension globally**:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```
   (You've already done this step)

2. **Create a global configuration file**:
   Create or edit `~/.config/goose/goose.toml`:
   ```toml
   [tools]
   calendar = "goose_calendar.toolkit:CalendarToolkit"
   ```

3. **Restart Goose Desktop** to load the new extension

### Method 2: Manual Configuration in Goose Desktop

1. **Open Goose Desktop**
2. **Go to Settings/Preferences**
3. **Look for "Extensions" or "Toolkits" section**
4. **Add the calendar toolkit**:
   - Toolkit name: `calendar`
   - Module path: `goose_calendar.toolkit:CalendarToolkit`

### Method 3: Configuration File Location

The desktop version might look for configuration in different locations:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Goose/goose.toml`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Goose/goose.toml`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/goose/goose.toml`

Create the configuration file in the appropriate location:
```toml
[tools]
calendar = "goose_calendar.toolkit:CalendarToolkit"

[settings]
# Optional calendar settings
calendar.default_timezone = "America/New_York"
calendar.max_events = 20
```

### Verification Steps

1. **Restart Goose Desktop** after adding the configuration
2. **Test the extension** by asking Goose:
   - "List my calendar events"
   - "What's on my calendar today?"
   - "Add a meeting tomorrow at 2 PM"

### Troubleshooting Desktop Version

If the extension doesn't appear:

1. **Check Goose Desktop logs** (usually in the app's menu under Help > Show Logs)
2. **Verify Python environment**: The desktop version might use a different Python environment
3. **Install in system Python**: Try installing the extension in your system Python:
   ```bash
   pip3 install -e . --break-system-packages
   ```
4. **Check extension loading**: Look for error messages about "calendar" toolkit in the logs

## âœ… Ready for Goose Desktop

This extension is now properly structured as an **MCP server** and ready to be added to Goose Desktop!

   cd /Users/adamhajari/Develop/goose-calendar-ext-cp
